A simple macOS webview wrapper around netflix.com to add conveniences for watching Netflix on desktop.

## Features

-   Always on top. The window never leaves your sight.
-   Adjusts to each show's aspect ratio.
-   Drag anywhere to move the window.

## Why

Mainly to practice macOS development.

I like to practice Spanish by putting on a Spanish-language Netflix show as I otherwise relax on the computer. I wanted a tiny picture-in-picture solution so that I could idly participate while multi-tasking.

It's also an exploration into how hard it is to drive the Netflix UI externally.
