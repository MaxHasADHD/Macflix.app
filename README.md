## Why

Mainly to practice macOS development.

I like to practice Spanish by putting on a Spanish-language Netflix show as I otherwise relax on the computer. I wanted a tiny picture-in-picture solution so that I could idly participate while multi-tasking.

It's also an exploration into how hard it is to drive the Netflix UI externally.
